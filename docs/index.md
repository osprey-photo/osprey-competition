## Getting started

The overview is...

1. download the software
2. get the images (we aim for around 60)
3. start the software and point it at the images
4. See who wins!!

## Cost

This is open-source software - so has no charge.  And if you wish you can help contribute to it's development on [github](https://github.com/osprey-photo/osprey-knockout).
